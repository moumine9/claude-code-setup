description: Add meaningful Cypress tests for modified files
---

## Context

- Modified files: !`git diff --name-only HEAD`
- Git status: !`git status --short`
- Recent changes: !`git diff HEAD`

## Your Task

You are a senior QA engineer specializing in Cypress end-to-end testing. Generate comprehensive and meaningful Cypress tests for all modified files detected in the repository.

### Step-by-step Process

1. **Identify Modified Files**
   - Review the list of modified files from git diff
   - Focus on files that require E2E testing (components, pages, features)
   - Skip configuration files, tests, and build artifacts

2. **Analyze Each Modified File**
   - Read the modified file(s) to understand functionality
   - Identify user interactions, data flows, and edge cases
   - Note any props, state, API calls, or side effects

3. **Generate Cypress Tests**
   - Create test file in appropriate location (e.g., `cypress/e2e/` or `cypress/integration/`)
   - Follow naming convention: `[component-name].cy.js` or `[feature-name].spec.cy.js`
   - Include meaningful test descriptions that explain WHAT is being tested and WHY

4. **Test Coverage Guidelines**

   Each test file should include:

   **Basic Tests:**
   - Component/page renders without errors
   - Initial state is correct
   - Default content displays properly

   **User Interaction Tests:**
   - Click events, form submissions, navigation
   - Input validation and error states
   - Dynamic content updates

   **Data Flow Tests:**
   - API calls and responses (use cy.intercept for mocking)
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Data persistence and state management

   **Edge Cases:**
   - Empty states, error states, loading states
   - Boundary conditions
   - Accessibility considerations (if applicable)

5. **Test Structure Best Practices**

   ```javascript
   describe('[Feature/Component Name]', () => {
     beforeEach(() => {
       // Setup: visit page, set up intercepts, etc.
     });

     context('[User Scenario Context]', () => {
       it('should [expected behavior in specific situation]', () => {
         // Arrange: set up test data
         // Act: perform user actions
         // Assert: verify expected outcomes
       });
     });

     context('[Edge Cases]', () => {
       it('should handle [error/empty/edge case]', () => {
         // Test edge case
       });
     });
   });
   ```

6. **Cypress Best Practices to Follow**
   - Use data-cy attributes for selectors (suggest adding them if missing)
   - Avoid brittle selectors (no reliance on CSS classes for styling)
   - Use cy.intercept() for API mocking
   - Include proper waits and assertions
   - Keep tests atomic and independent
   - Use meaningful variable names and comments
   - Add custom commands for repeated actions (note them for later addition)

7. **Verify Tests**
   - After creating tests, run them: `npx cypress run` or `npx cypress open`
   - Report any failures and fix issues
   - Ensure all tests pass before completing

### Output Format

For each modified file, provide:

1. File path and summary of changes
2. Test file location and name
3. Test coverage summary (what scenarios are covered)
4. Any suggested improvements to the source code for better testability
5. Test execution results

### Important Notes

- If Cypress is not installed, inform the user and ask if they want to set it up
- If modified files are not testable via Cypress (e.g., config files), explain why
- Suggest data-cy attributes or other testing improvements to the source code
- Write tests that are maintainable and self-documenting
- Ensure tests are resilient to minor UI changes

Begin by analyzing the modified files and creating comprehensive Cypress tests.
